#Growing technical practices

On a OOP paradigm.

##What subjects?
By what subjects I mean, what core practices should we have? I decided to use the Extreme Programming practices cantered around the individual.These practices are: Test-Driven Development, Refactoring, Simple Design and Pair Programming as shown in the image bellow.

![XP Practices](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/circles.jpg)

The four individual technical practices in XP form the four pillars. Now these practices leave a lot to be defined so I decided to try to narrow them down to a core of more specific practices, that could be used. I came up the the list bellow:

### Technical pratices
* Test Driven Development 
  * Classic TDD 
  * Mocking
  * Outside in TDD / London School of TDD
* Refactoring 
  * IDE productivity
  * Code smells
  * Refactoring smellspo
  * Refactoring legacy code
* Simple Design 
  * 4 elements of simple design
  * SOLID principles
  * Design patterns
  * Domain Driven Design
* Pair programming 
  * Driver-navigator
  * Ping-pong / Chess clock
  * Pomodoro
  * Pair rotation

##What order?

Is there a dependency in technical practices? Can I do refactoring if I'm not proficient with TDD?

* XP intro
* TDD intro
* Pair programming

* TDD habits
* Transformation Priority Premise

* Object Calisthenics
* The 4 elements of simple design
* Test doubles

* Code smells
* Refactoring
* Legacy code
* Characterization tests
* Golden Master

* SOLID principles
* Design Patterns

* Outside in TDD aka London school of TDD
* BDD

* DDD

##How much?
By how much I mean, how can I measure my degree of proficiency in a technical practice. We have a tendency, as human beings, either to overestimate or to underestimate our proficiency in a subject or task. There are two well known psychological phenomenon. The Dunning–Kruger effect and the Impostor syndrome. Both are at extremes:

####[Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
*"The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein relatively unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than is accurate. This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to accurately evaluate their own ability level. Conversely, highly skilled individuals may underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks that are easy for them are also easy for others."*

####[Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)
*"Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be."*

###The Conscious Competence Ladder
When I was studding to be a musician I was exposed to the The Conscious Competence Ladder, I found it fascinating and still use it as a way to "measure" my competency at a task. I have no background in psychology or pedagogy, so this may be an outdated form of "measuring" task proficiency. I leave it here, more as a suggestion, on how we could "measure" proficiency in each of the technical practices. 

*"The psychology, the four stages of competence, or the "conscious competence" learning model, relates to the psychological states involved in the process of progressing from incompetence to competence in a skill."* [1](#####Four stages of competence)

![Four stages of competence](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Competence_Hierarchy_adapted_from_Noel_Burch_by_Igor_Kokcharov.jpg)

###Level 1 Unconsciously Incompetence
*"The individual does not understand or know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage. The length of time an individual spends in this stage depends on the strength of the stimulus to learn."* [1](#####Four stages of competence)
 
###Level 2 Consciously Incompetence
*"Though the individual does not understand or know how to do something, he or she does recognize the deficit, as well as the value of a new skill in addressing the deficit. The making of mistakes can be integral to the learning process at this stage"* [1](#####Four stages of competence)

###Level 3 Consciously Competence
*"The individual understands or knows how to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge requires concentration. It may be broken down into steps, and there is heavy conscious involvement in executing the new skill."* [1](#####Four stages of competence)

###Level 4 Unconsciously Competence
*"The individual has had so much practice with a skill that it has become "second nature" and can be performed easily. As a result, the skill can be performed while executing another task. The individual may be able to teach it to others, depending upon how and when it was learned."* [1](#####Four stages of competence)

##More than just technical practices

Even if your personal or team technical practices are at a high level this is unfortunately not sufficient inside organizations. You need to be able to influence or lead other
