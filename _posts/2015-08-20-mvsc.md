###The Conscious Competence Ladder
Îéí psychology, the four stages of competence, or the "conscious competence" learning model, relates to the psychological states involved in the process of progressing from incompetence to competence in a skill.Îéí1](#####Four stages of competence)

![Four stages of competence](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Competence_Hierarchy_adapted_from_Noel_Burch_by_Igor_Kokcharov.jpg)

###Level 1 Unconsciously Unskilled
"The individual does not understand or know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage. The length of time an individual spends in this stage depends on the strength of the stimulus to learn." [1](#####Four stages of competence)

###Level 2 Consciously Unskilled
"Though the individual does not understand or know how to do something, he or she does recognize the deficit, as well as the value of a new skill in addressing the deficit. The making of mistakes can be integral to the learning process at this stage" [1](#####Four stages of competence)

###Level 3 Consciously Skilled
"The individual understands or knows how to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge requires concentration. It may be broken down into steps, and there is heavy conscious involvement in executing the new skill" [1](#####Four stages of competence)

###Level 4 Unconsciously Skilled
"The individual has had so much practice with a skill that it has become "second nature" and can be performed easily. As a result, the skill can be performed while executing another task. The individual may be able to teach it to others, depending upon how and when it was learned." [1](#####Four stages of competence)

The Minimum Viable Software Craftsman should have the skills listed [above](##Skills) at least at level 3 of the Conscious Competence Ladder.
