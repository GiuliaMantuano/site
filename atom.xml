        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Developers across many organisations adopted code reviews as one of their core practices. Although that sounds a very reasonable thing to do, overtime the goal that led to the adoption of the practice is forgotten and the only thing left is the mindless application of the practice itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I decided to include Swagger documentation to our time sheet application. Although Swagger provides tools to help clients integrate with your REST API the most powerful feature, in my opinion, is that it acts as &quot;living documentation&quot; for the API. Adding Swagger to my the application had a couple of pleasant side-effects:&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many metaphors to software development that make sense within different contexts but not others. When we talk about craftsmanship as a metaphor we are referring to the attitudes that the craftsman embodies in terms of dedication to customer satisfaction, quality and endless pursuit of excellence. Metaphors are a wonderful aid to comprehension where we can lift desired qualities from a well understood concept and use that to explain a new one. However, we must be careful on how we apply the metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;

Alongside NoSql, Functional Programming and Microservices, these revival concepts are getting traction because of their ability to deal with modern software challenges. Assuming that you&#39;re building a product that has a complex domain with a significant amount of users I can predict that if you follow more traditional architectural styles you will face the following problems how to scale and how to deal with complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

I passed by all the checks Github does to make sure you know what you&#39;re doing, thinking I was about to delete the fork I accidentally created. When I saw afterwards that the fork was still there, I immediately realized what I had done.&lt;/p&gt;

That&#39;s one of the things that you learn in our apprenticeship program: to be able to do TDD without thinking about it and feel as if it&#39;s natural: as you breath to survive you do TDD to code.&lt;/p&gt;
