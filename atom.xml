        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Katas are great, but not enough. In the past year I’ve been trying to find ways to teach our craftsmen and apprentices how to design software. Although we could discuss good design principles, it was very difficult to find a way to practice them. Katas are great for learning TDD, micro design, working in baby steps, and a few techniques for dealing with legacy code but we need more. We would like to practice requirements gathering, domain modelling, and well-crafted code all together, with the same fast feedback loop we get when we do katas. The problem is that we need a far bigger problem with overlapping rules so that we can experience incremental software design. Inspired by a session we had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socrates-conference.de/&quot;&gt;SoCraTes Germany 2015&lt;/a&gt;, we are evolving a deliberate practice session that allows us to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

Some people are calling it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/domain-driven-architecture&quot;&gt;Demand-Driven Architecture&lt;/a&gt;, but before I show you some solutions, let&#39;s go over some history to understand the problem. I will use the example that Netflix provides, but I think that most of us will find the patterns familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

Although that sounds like a very reasonable thing to do, over time the goal that led to the adoption of the practice is forgotten and the only thing left is the mindless application of the practice itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Although Swagger provides tools to help clients integrate with your REST API the most powerful feature, in my opinion, is that it acts as &quot;living documentation&quot; for the API. Adding Swagger to my the application had a couple of pleasant side-effects:&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many metaphors to software development that make sense within different contexts but not others. When we talk about craftsmanship as a metaphor we are referring to the attitudes that the craftsman embodies in terms of dedication to customer satisfaction, quality and endless pursuit of excellence. Metaphors are a wonderful aid to comprehension where we can lift desired qualities from a well understood concept and use that to explain a new one. However, we must be careful on how we apply the metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;
