        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing are concepts that are not new at all. Alongside NoSql, Functional Programming and Microservices, these revival concepts are getting traction because of their ability to deal with modern software challenges. Assuming that you&#39;re building a product that has a complex domain with a significant amount of users I can predict that if you follow more traditional architectural styles you will face the following problems how to scale and how to deal with complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

This made the website unavailable for the first time in a long time, and during best business hours.
I passed by all the checks Github does to make sure you know what you&#39;re doing, thinking I was about to delete the fork I accidentally created. When I saw afterwards that the fork was still there, I immediately realized what I had done.&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;m learning to be a Craftsman, so TDD is an essential technique to know. It&#39;s your main tool. At Codurance it&#39;s unthinkable that you could code without doing TDD. That&#39;s one of the things that you learn in our apprenticeship program: to be able to do TDD without thinking about it and feel as if it&#39;s natural: as you breath to survive you do TDD to code.&lt;/p&gt;

Companies value the flexibility and reliability provided by such services. The simplicity of the solutions delivered by cloud providers should remove the burden from the shoulders of busy Dev and Ops people and give the possibility to focus on real customer&#39;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve seen a few “Big Data” projects start in the past with a lot of fanfare and promise.The promise has always been that “we will start getting a holistic picture of our departmental silos and gain numerous insights from our data that will help us get ahead of our competitors”. The promise was rarely, if ever, fulfilled and the “Big Data” team slowly faded into the rest of the melting pot that we call the “IT department” in most large enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;em&gt;tl;dr&lt;/em&gt; part of any SLA, the bit the everyone is actually interested in, is the uptime guarantee. However, this seemingly simple number has some hidden meanings that you should be aware of when designing applications and reporting your SLAs to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

I was also saying that we probably should teach design before TDD (or at least, at the same time). This tweet led to a discussions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbrains&quot;&gt;J.B. Rainsberger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RonJeffries&quot;&gt;Ron Jeffries&lt;/a&gt;, and a few others.
